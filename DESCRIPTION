Description:
    Provides functions for constructing near-optimal generalized full matchings.
    Generalized full matching is an extension of the original full matching method
    to situations with more intricate study designs. The package is made with
    large data sets in mind and derives matchings more than an order of magnitude
    quicker than other methods.
