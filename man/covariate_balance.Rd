\usage{
covariate_balance(treatments, covariates, matching = NULL, subset = NULL,
  normalize = TRUE, all_differences = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{treatments}{factor specifying which treatments the units are assigned to.}

\item{covariates}{vector, matrix or data frame with covariates to measure balance for.}

\item{matching}{\code{\link{qm_matching}} or \code{\link[scclust]{scclust}} object with
the matched groups, or \code{NULL}.}

\item{subset}{units to target the estimation for. If \code{NULL}, the estimate will
pertain to all units in the sample (i.e., ATE). A non-null value
specificies a subset of units that the estimate should pertain to (e.g.,
ATT or ATC). If \code{subset} is a logical vector with the same length as
the sample size, units indicated with \code{TRUE} will be included. If
\code{subset} is an integer vector, the units with indices in \code{subset}
are included. Indices starts at 1 and \code{subset} must be sorted. If
\code{subset} is a character vector, it should contain treatment labels,
and the corresponding units (as given by \code{treatments}) will be
included in the estimation.}

\item{normalize}{logical indicating whether differences should be normalized by the standard
deviation of the covariate.}

\item{all_differences}{logical indicating whether full matrices of differences should be reported.
If \code{FALSE}, only the maximum difference for each covariate is returned.}
}
\value{
Returns estimated treatment effects. A list with two numeric matrix with
   all estimated treatment effects and their estimated variances is returned.
   The first matrix (\code{effects}) contains estimated treatment effects.
   Rows in this matrix indicate minuends in the treatment effect contrast and
   columns indicate subtrahends. For example, in the matrix:
   \tabular{rrrr}{
     \tab a \tab b \tab c\cr
     a \tab 0.0 \tab 4.5 \tab 5.5\cr
     b \tab -4.5 \tab 0.0 \tab 1.0\cr
     c \tab -5.5 \tab -1.0 \tab 0.0\cr
   }
   the estimated treatment effect between conditions \eqn{a} and \eqn{b} is
   \eqn{4.5}, and the estimated treatment effect between conditions \eqn{c}
   and \eqn{b} is \eqn{-1.0}. Or in symbols: \eqn{E[Y(a) - Y(b)] = 4.5} and
   \eqn{E[Y(c) - Y(b)] = -1.0}.

   The second matrix (\code{effect_variances}) contains estimates of
   variances of the corresponding effect estimators.
