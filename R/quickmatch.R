#' Construct generalized full matchings
#'
#' \code{quickmatch} constructs generalized full matchings. The function constructs a
#' near-optimal matching so that units assigned to the same group are as similar as
#' possible. The function expects the user to provide distances measuring the
#' similarity of the units and a set of matching constraints.
#'
#' The \code{treatment_constraints} argument should contain a named vector with
#' all treatment-specific constraints. For example, in a sample with treatment
#' conditions "A", "B" and "C", the vector \code{c("A" = 1, "B" = 2, "C" = 0)}
#' specifies that each matched group should contain at least one unit with
#' treatment "A", at least two units with treatment "B" and any number of units
#' with treatment "C". Treatments not specified in the vector defaults to zero.
#' For example, the vector \code{c("A" = 1, "B" = 2)} is identical to the
#' previous one. When \code{NULL}, the parameter defaults to requiring at least
#' one unit for each treatment. In our current example, \code{NULL} would be
#' shorthand for \code{c("A" = 1, "B" = 1, "C" = 1)}.
#'
#' The \code{size_constraint} argument can be used to constrain the matched
#' groups to contain at least a certain number of units in total (independently of
#' treatment assignment). For example, if \code{treatment_constraints =
#' c("A" = 1, "B" = 2)} and \code{total_size_constraint = 4}, each matched
#' group will contain at least one unit assigned to "A", at least two units
#' assigned to "B" and at least four units in total, where the fourth unit can
#' be from any treatment condition.
#'
#' The \code{target} argument can be used to control which units are included
#' in the matching. When \code{target} is \code{NULL} (the default), all units
#' will be assigned to a matched group. When not \code{NULL}, the argument
#' indicates that some units can safely be ignored when the groups are
#' constructed. This can be useful, for example, when one is interested in
#' estimating treatment effects only for a certain type of units (e.g., the
#' average treatment effect for the treated, ATT). It is particularly useful
#' when units of interested are not represented in the whole covariate space
#' (i.e., an one-sided overlap problem). Without the \code{target} argument,
#' the function would in such cases try to assign every unit to a group,
#' including units in sparse regions that we are not interested in. This could
#' lead to unnecessarily large and diverse matched groups. We can avoid such
#' situations by specifying in \code{target} that some units safely can be ignored.
#'
#' As an example, assume that the units are assigned to either of two treatment
#' conditions, "A" and "B". Units assigned to "B" are more numerous and tend to
#' have more extreme covariate values. We are, however, only interested in
#' estimating the treatment effect for units assigned to "A". By specifying
#' \code{target = "A"}, the function ensures that all those units are assigned
#' to a matched group. Some units assigned to treatment "B" -- in particular
#' the units with extreme covariate values -- will be left unassigned. However,
#' as those units are not of interest, they can safely be ignored, and we
#' avoid groups with poor qualities.
#'
#' The default behavior when \code{target} is non-NULL is to assign as many
#' units as possible without increasing the maximum within-group distance. This
#' behavior might, however, increase the average within-group distance in some
#' cases. If called with \code{secondary_unassigned_method = "ignore"}, units
#' not specified in \code{target} will be ignored unless they are absolutely
#' needed to satisfying the matching constraints. This tends to reduce bias
#' since the within-group distances are minimized, but it could increase
#' variance since we ignore potentially useful information in the sample. An
#' intermediate alternative is to specify an aggressive caliper for the
#' secondary units, which is done with the \code{secondary_radius} argument.
#' (These arguments are part of the \code{\link[scclust]{sc_clustering}}
#' function that \code{quickmatch} calls. The \code{target} argument
#' corresponds to the \code{primary_data_points} argument in that function.)
#'
#' The \code{caliper} argument constrains the maximum distance between units
#' assigned to the same matched group. This is implemented by restricting the
#' edge weight in the graph used to construct the matched groups (see
#' \code{\link[scclust]{sc_clustering}} for details). As a result, the caliper
#' will affect all groups in the matching and, in general, make it harder for
#' the function to find good matchings even for groups where the caliper is not
#' binding. In particular, a too tight \code{caliper} can lead to discarded
#' units that otherwise would be assigned to a group satisfying both the
#' matching constraints and the caliper. For this reason, it is recommended
#' to set \code{caliper} quite high and only use it to avoid particularly poor
#' matches. It strongly recommended to use the \code{caliper} argument only
#' when \code{primary_unassigned_method = "closest_seed"} in the underlying
#' \code{\link[scclust]{sc_clustering}} function (which is the default
#' behavior).
#'
#' @param distances
#'    \code{\link[distances]{distances}} object or a numeric vector, matrix
#'    or data frame. The argument describes the similarity of the units to be
#'    matched. It can either be preprocessed distance information from a
#'    \code{\link[distances]{distances}} object, or raw
#'    covariate data. When called with covariate data, Euclidean distances are
#'    calculated unless otherwise specified.
#' @param treatments
#'    factor specifying which treatments the units are assigned to.
#' @param treatment_constraints
#'    named integer vector with the treatment constraints. If \code{NULL},
#'    the constraints are set so to requiring one unit of each treatment
#'    condition in each group.
#' @param size_constraint
#'    integer with the required total number of units in each group. Must be
#'    greater or equal to the sum of \code{treatment_constraints}. If NULL, no
#'    constraints other than the treatment constraints are imposed.
#' @param target
#'    units to target the matching for. All units indicated by \code{target} are
#'    ensured to be assigned to a matched group (disregarding eventual
#'    \code{caliper} setting). Units not indicated by \code{target} could be
#'    left unassigned if they are not necessary to satisfy the matching
#'    constraints. If \code{NULL}, \code{quickmatch} targets all units and
#'    ensures that all units are assigned to a group. If \code{target} is a
#'    logical vector with the same length as the sample size, units indicated
#'    with \code{TRUE} will be targeted. If \code{target} is an integer vector,
#'    the units with indices in \code{target} are targeted. Indices starts at 1
#'    and \code{target} must be sorted. If \code{target} is a character vector,
#'    it should contain treatment labels, and the corresponding units (as given
#'    by \code{treatments}) will be targeted.
#' @param caliper
#'    restrict the maximum within-group distance.
#' @param ...
#'    additional parameters to be sent either to the
#'    \code{\link[distances]{distances}} function when \code{distances} contains
#'    covariate data, or to the underlying \code{\link[scclust]{sc_clustering}}
#'    function.
#'
#' @return
#'    Returns a \code{\link{qm_matching}} object with the matched groups.
#'
#' @seealso
#'   See \code{\link[scclust]{sc_clustering}} for the underlying function used
#'   to construct the matched groups.
