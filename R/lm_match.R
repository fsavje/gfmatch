#' Regression-based matching estimator of treatment effects
#'
#' \code{lm_match} estimates treatment effects in matched samples. The function
#' expects the user to provide the outcomes, treatment indicators, and a matching
#' object. It returns point estimates of the average treatment effects and variance
#' estimates. It is possible to estimate treatment effects for subsets of the
#' observations, such as estimates of the average treatment effect for the treated
#' (ATT).
#'
#' \code{lm_match} estimates treatment effects using weighted regression. The
#' function first derives the unit-level weights implied by the matching. In
#' detail, let \eqn{S(g)} be the number of units indicated by \code{target} in
#' group \eqn{g}. Let \eqn{T} be the total number of units indicated by
#' \code{target} in sample. Let \eqn{A(t, g)} be the number of units assigned
#' to treatment \eqn{t} in group \eqn{g}. The weight for a unit in group \eqn{g}
#' that is assigned to treatment \eqn{t} is given by:
#'
#' \deqn{\frac{S(g)}{T \times A(t, g)}.}{S(g) / [T * A(t, g)].}
#'
#' See \code{\link{matching_weights}} for more details.
#'
#' The function uses the derived weights in a weighted least squares regression
#' (using the \code{\link[stats]{lm}} function) with indicator variables for the
#' treatment conditions. Optionally, covariates can be added to the regression
#' (e.g., a common recommendation is to include the covariates used to construct
#' the matching). Standard errors are estimated with the heteroskedasticity-robust
#' "HC1" estimator in the \code{\link[sandwich]{vcovHC}} function. Units not
#' assigned to matched groups and units assigned weights of zero are excluded
#' from the estimation.
#'
#' @param outcomes
#'    numeric vector with observed outcomes.
#' @param treatments
#'    factor specifying the units' treatment assignments.
#' @param matching
#'    \code{\link{qm_matching}} or \code{\link[scclust]{scclust}} object with
#'    the matched groups.
#' @param covariates
#'    vector, matrix or data frame with covariates to include in the estimation.
#'    If \code{NULL}, no covariates are included.
#' @param target
#'    units to target the estimation for. If \code{NULL}, the effect is estimated
#'    for all units in the sample (i.e., ATE). A non-null value specifies a
#'    subset of units for which the effect should be estimated (e.g., ATT or
#'    ATC). If \code{target} is a logical vector with the same length as the
#'    sample size, units indicated with \code{TRUE} will be targeted. If
#'    \code{target} is an integer vector, the units with indices in \code{target}
#'    are targeted. If \code{target} is a character vector, it should contain
#'    treatment labels, and the effect for the corresponding units (as given by
#'    \code{treatments}) will be estimated.
#'
#' @return
#'    A list with two numeric matrices with all estimated treatment effects and
#'    their estimated variances is returned. The first matrix (\code{effects})
#'    contains estimated treatment effects. Rows in this matrix indicate minuends
#'    in the treatment effect contrast and columns indicate subtrahends. For
#'    example, in the matrix:
#'    \tabular{rrrr}{
#'      \tab a \tab b \tab c\cr
#'      a \tab 0.0 \tab 4.5 \tab 5.5\cr
#'      b \tab -4.5 \tab 0.0 \tab 1.0\cr
#'      c \tab -5.5 \tab -1.0 \tab 0.0\cr
#'    }
#'    the estimated treatment effect between conditions \eqn{a} and \eqn{b} is
#'    \eqn{4.5}, and the estimated treatment effect between conditions \eqn{c}
#'    and \eqn{b} is \eqn{-1.0}. In symbols, \eqn{E[Y(a) - Y(b) | S] = 4.5} and
#'    \eqn{E[Y(c) - Y(b) | S] = -1.0} where \eqn{S} is the condition set
#'    indicated by the \code{target} parameter.
#'
#'    The second matrix (\code{effect_variances}) contains estimates of
#'    variances of the corresponding effect estimators.
