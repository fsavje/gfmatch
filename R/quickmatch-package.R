#' quickmatch: Quick Generalized Full Matching
#'
#' Provides functions for constructing near-optimal generalized full matchings.
#' Generalized full matching is an extension of the original full matching method
#' to situations with more intricate study designs. The package is made with
#' large data sets in mind and derives matchings more than an order of magnitude
#' quicker than other methods.
#'
#' See \code{\link{quickmatch}} for the main matching function.
#'
#' See the package's website for more information:
#' \url{https://github.com/fsavje/quickmatch}.
#'
#' Bug reports and suggestions are greatly appreciated. They are best reported
#' here: \url{https://github.com/fsavje/quickmatch/issues}.
