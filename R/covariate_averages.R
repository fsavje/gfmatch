#' Covariate averages in matched sample
#'
#' \code{covariate_averages} derives covariate averages for treatment groups in
#' matched samples.
#'
#' \code{covariate_averages} calculates covariate averages by first deriving
#' the average for each covariate for each treatment conditions in each matched
#' group. It then aggregates the group averages by a weighted average, where the
#' \code{target} parameter decides the weights. If a matched group contains many
#' units not targeted (e.g., control units when ATT is of interest), those units
#' will contribute less to the covariate average for the corresponding treatment
#' condition than units in matched groups with many targeted units. This means that
#' the covariate average is calculated in the same way as the potential outcomes
#' are estimated. In fact, \code{covariate_averages} can be used as an estimator
#' for potential outcomes by calling it with the outcome variable as a covariate.
#'
#' When the average treatment effect (ATE) is of interest (i.e., \code{target == NULL}),
#' the matched groups will be weighted by their sizes. When \code{target} indicates
#' that some subset of units is of interest, the number of such units in each matched
#' group will decide its weight. For example, if we are interested in the average
#' treatment effect of the treated (ATT), the weight of a group will be proportional
#' to the number of treated units in that group.
#'
#' In practice, the function first derives the unit-level weights implied by the
#' matching. In detail, let \eqn{S(g)} be the number of units indicated by
#' \code{target} in group \eqn{g}. Let \eqn{T} be the total number of units
#' indicated by \code{target} in the sample. Let \eqn{A(t, g)} be the number of
#' units assigned to treatment \eqn{t} in group \eqn{g}. The weight for a unit
#' in group \eqn{g} that is assigned to treatment \eqn{t} is given by:
#'
#' \deqn{\frac{S(g)}{T \times A(t, g)}.}{S(g) / [T * A(t, g)].}
#'
#' See \code{\link{matching_weights}} for more details.
#'
#' \code{covariate_averages} focuses on means, but higher moments and interactions
#' can be investigated by adding corresponding columns to the covariate matrix
#' (see examples below).
#'
#' @param treatments
#'    factor specifying the units' treatment assignments.
#' @param covariates
#'    vector, matrix or data frame with covariates to calculate averages for.
#' @param matching
#'    \code{\link{qm_matching}} or \code{\link[scclust]{scclust}} object with
#'    the matched groups. If \code{NULL}, averages are derived for the unmatched
#'    sample.
#' @param target
#'    units to target the averages for. If \code{NULL}, the averages will
#'    be the raw average over all units in the sample (i.e., ATE). A non-null
#'    value specifies a subset of units to derive averages for (e.g.,
#'    ATT or ATC). If \code{target} is a logical vector with the same length as
#'    the sample size, units indicated with \code{TRUE} will be targeted. If
#'    \code{target} is an integer vector, the units with indices in \code{target}
#'    are targeted. If \code{target} is a character vector, it should contain
#'    treatment labels, and the corresponding units (as given by
#'    \code{treatments}) will be targeted. If \code{matching} is \code{NULL},
#'    \code{target} is ignored.
#'
#' @return
#'    Returns a matrix with the average of each covariate for each treatment
#'    group. The rows in the matrix correspond to the covariates in order and
#'    the columns correspond to the treatment groups. For example, a possible
#'    output with three treatment groups ("C", "T1" and "T2") and four
#'    covariates is:
#'    \tabular{rrr}{
#'      C \tab T1 \tab T2\cr
#'      3.0 \tab 3.3 \tab 3.5\cr
#'      -0.3 \tab 0.0 \tab -0.2\cr
#'      0.1 \tab 0.2 \tab 0.0\cr
#'      5.0 \tab 5.1 \tab 4.9\cr
#'    }
#'    which indicates that the average of the first covariate in the matched
#'    sample is 3.0 for units assigned to condition "C", and that the average
#'    of the third covariate is 0.2 for units assigned to condition "T1".
